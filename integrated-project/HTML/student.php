                        My name is Salmane Tamo, and I just completed my second year in my Computing major at the African Leadership University in Mauritius. I am currently interning in a public institution called <strong>Agence Nationale pour la Societe de l'Information</strong>. It is based in Niamey , the capital city of my country, Niger.<br>After going through this first year in the Computing major, I have decided that it would be best for me to choose an internship where I could get some exposure to the field. Even though I am still at a beginner level with limited skills, I thought getting exposed will not only help me guide my career decisions but also make sense of some of the concepts that we have explored throughout the year.<br>I also wanted an internship in my home country so that I could at least get an overview of how in the industry looks like in the country. Another reason was that I just wanted to be home with family.

We finished with the IPv6 technology(why use it, configuring devices, etc).</p>
